h1. grid.js

grid.js is a cheeky bit of javascript that does some silly laying out of <div>'s and <hr>'s to achieve an underlaying grid for the purpose of aiding design..

Currently it's made up of only divs, with appropriate margins and paddings set in grid.less to demonstrate the horizontal and vertical grid of the 'lesser framework'.

On the roadmap is to make it a little smarter, by making use of a combination of div's and hr's, rather than the 'blurt' of hundreds of only divs, to achieve a similar effect -- perhaps a little more informative and useful.
